# Neevas Internship Tasks

## Task 1: Data Cleaning and Visualization

This repository contains the work completed for Task 1 of the Neevas internship program. The task involved data cleaning and visualization using Python.

### Files

- `Data Cleaning And Visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations.
- `Code Overview.JPG`: Screenshot of the first part of the code.
- `Code Overview1.JPG`: Screenshot of the second part of the code.
- `Code Overview2.JPG`: Screenshot of the third part of the code.
- `Histogram.JPG`: Histogram of the distribution of number of speakers.
- `Bar Plot.JPG`: Bar plot of the count of languages by region.
- `Scatter Plot.JPG`: Scatter plot of speakers by region.
- `Seaborn Heatmap.JPG`: Seaborn heatmap of the correlation matrix.

### Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Data Cleaning And Visualization.ipynb`) to view the code and visualizations.
2. Check the images named `Code Overview.JPG`, `Code Overview1.JPG`, and `Code Overview2.JPG` for screenshots of the complete code.
3. View the other images for specific visualizations.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Files

- `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis for the cancer dataset.
- `cancer_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `1.JPG`: Screenshot of the first part of the code.
- `2.JPG`: Screenshot of the second part of the code.
- `3.JPG`: Screenshot of the third part of the code.
- `4.JPG`: Screenshot of the fourth part of the code.
- `5.JPG`: Screenshot of the fifth part of the code.
- `6.JPG`: Screenshot of the sixth part of the code.
- `7.JPG`: Screenshot of the seventh part of the code.
- `8.JPG`: Screenshot of the eighth part of the code.
- `9.JPG`: Screenshot of the ninth part of the code.
- `10.JPG`: Screenshot of the tenth part of the code.

### Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`) to review the EDA performed on the cancer dataset.
2. Refer to the images named `1.JPG` through `10.JPG` for a visual summary of the complete code.

### Upcoming Tasks

Additional tasks will be added to this repository as part of the Neevas internship program. Stay tuned for further updates.
